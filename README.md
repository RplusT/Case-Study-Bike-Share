# Case Study: Bike Share

This case study involves a fictional bike sharing company whose goal is to increase its annual memberships. The business task is to determine the differences in riding behavior of members and casual riders. From these insights, the bike sharing company’s marketing team can design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

The dataset used is from a real bike sharing company based in Chicago, Illinois, USA. This analysis covers data from April 2020 to March 2021 which involves 3,489,748 bike rides.

## Conclusion/Findings

The main difference between casual riders and members is that the former uses the bikes mainly for leisure. This is evidenced by the fact that they ride more during the weekends, have longer ride durations, and originate and end their rides near local attractions.

Members meanwhile have a more set routine given their ride durations are more consistent during the week and throughout the day. The bike stations they use are near residential areas and the city center suggesting they use the bikes mainly for commuting.

## Recommendations

1. Marketing efforts should be focused on areas near local attractions.

    Collaborations with commercial establishments in these areas should be explored.
    Examples are providing discount vouchers for new members and/or a member point system wherein points can be redeemed in nearby shops.

2. In terms of scheduling, the best time to target casual riders are during weekend afternoons between 4-6pm.

    Casual riders do most of their riding during this time.
    To maximize the reach, marketing efforts would be best focused during the summer months as riding activity is significantly higher given the weather and a better outdoor experience on the bike.

3. While casual riders mostly frequent local attractions, there is also room for converting casual riders involving members in stations near residential areas and the city center.

    There are also casual riders who use the bikes for commuting and members are the best positioned to demonstrate the benefits of a full membership.
    Examples can be providing referral discounts to members which they can share to a set number of casual riders. Members can then be compensated with discounted membership rates or other promotions.
    Weekend group rides can also be a way to activate more members. Members can lead casual riders around the city, with a set route provided by the company.
    Stops along the way can be setup with various marketing activations involving the community or more local shops.
